    "The method of joining all 8 files will simply be to:\n",

    "2. Join them together (using pd.concat(), since there shouldn't be any overlaps)\n",
    "3. Load in the third parquet file\n",

    "The file is then saved as a GeoJSON/gpkg (choose), which will be read in during the remainder of our analysis."
